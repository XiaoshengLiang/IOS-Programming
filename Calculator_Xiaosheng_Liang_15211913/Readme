Assignment 2 â€“ TipCalc
(revision 1.1)

Objectives: This assignment requires very little coding. You will use the current version
of Xcode to create a project and the built-in Interface Builder tool to construct a simple
user interface for a tip calculator. As you enter each digit of the bill, your app will update
the rounded tip amount for a given % tip set by moving a slider.
